# Linear_algebra_library_python
 
#  Mini Linear Algebra Library for AI & Computer Vision

A pure Python linear algebra library designed to **demystify the math** behind machine learning and computer vision â€” one matrix at a time.

This project rebuilds foundational vector and matrix operations from scratch, with real-world use cases in:
-  Neural networks
-  Linear regression & PCA
-  Image transformations
-  3D pose estimation

---

##  Features

-  `Vector` and `Matrix` classes with core operations
-  Affine transformations (rotation, scaling, translation)
-  Solving systems of equations (Gaussian elimination)
-  Least squares regression solver
-  PCA from scratch (eigen decomposition)
-  Image point transformation demo
-  No external libraries like NumPy or SciPy used
